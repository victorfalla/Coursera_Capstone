For which we will use 4 weather conditions with the highest number of incidents, 4 types of brightness in the area with the highest number of incidents, we will clean the data by eliminating the rows with null data and other data that we will not need at work. It will seek to catalog the areas according to the severity of accidents and to place warning signs to slow down."
